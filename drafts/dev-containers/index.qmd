- What problem are we trying to solve?
    - Don't want to install dependencies (effort, version clashes)
    - Switch between multiple envs
    - Dev env match Prod env
    - Standardized, team has same env
    - Don't know exactly what dependencies are needed, Documents dependencies
- Explication of Docker, images and containers
- Developing with containers
- Developing inside containers
